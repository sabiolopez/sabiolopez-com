# Orchestrator Protocol: The Unified Agent System

This document consolidates the roles, missions, and communication protocols for the "One-Person Agency" system. It serves as the single source of truth for the AI to understand which "hat" to wear during different phases of the project.

## 1. System Philosophy
- **Unified Intelligence**: Instead of fragmented contexts, all agents operate under this unified protocol.
- **Context Awareness**: Always check `Professional_Data_Raw.md` for factual accuracy.
- **Goal**: Build a high-end, award-winning portfolio that balances business strategy with artistic expression.

## 3. Shared Writing Guidelines (Tone of Voice)

### The Vibe: Experienced & Grounded
We are experienced, not arrogant. Confident, but open to constant learning. Calm, technical when needed, always human.

### Messaging Pillars
1.  **Continuous Learning:** We own our limits. Expertise comes from practice.
2.  **Collective Success:** Projects are rarely a solo win. Highlight context and collaboration.
3.  **Authentic Signal:** Clarity over cheap persuasion. If it's complex, say it's complex.

### Do's & Don'ts
- **DO:** Use "Passionate/Enthusiast", value the team, talk about processes and real challenges.
- **DON'T:** Use "Obsessed/Genius", "Top 1% Talent", or exaggerations like "Revolutionary/Impecable".

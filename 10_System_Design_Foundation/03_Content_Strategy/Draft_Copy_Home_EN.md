## 2. The Problems I Solve
*   **Engineering vs. Intuition:** Aligning complex technical requirements with user behavior in environments where "simple" is not an option.
*   **The Activation Gap:** Identifying why users aren't reaching the "Aha!" moment and redesigning journeys to accelerate time-to-value.
*   **Disconnected Growth:** Bridging the silo between product development and business metrics through continuous discovery and experimentation.

## 3. Areas of Expertise

**SaaS B2B & B2B2C Strategy**
Deep understanding of complex ecosystems. From mapping non-linear buyer journeys and Job-to-be-Done (JTBD) to granular segmentation and persona-based personalization. 

**Product & Growth Design**
Hypothesis-driven design integrated into the revenue engine. I focus on high-complexity technical products where design is a tool for validation, not just an output.

**AI Implementation**
I don't just talk about AI; I implement it. Using Large Language Models (LLMs) and custom agents to accelerate discovery, automate synthesis, and prototype intelligent product features.

## 4. Featured Work & Thoughts
**[ STATUS: CURATING_ARCHIVE ]**

I finally took some time off from debugging other people's products to fix my own. The gallery is currently being restored. I'm archiving legacy work to make room for new "Product-Led" cases and AI workflow insights. 

*Coming sooner than a pixel-perfect handoff.*

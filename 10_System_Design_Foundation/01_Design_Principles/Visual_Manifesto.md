# Visual Manifesto: Modernist Atelier

> "Clarity is the ultimate sophistication."

## 1. Core Philosophy
**Modernist Atelier** is the antithesis of noise. It is a breathing room for complex ideas. It draws inspiration from **Swiss Style** graphic design and high-end **Art Galleries**.

**Keywords:**
- *Airy* (Generous whitespace, breathing room)
- *Sophisticated* (Serif pairings, delicate lines)
- *Tactile* (Paper textures, warm grays)
- *Curated* (Few elements, high impact)

## 2. Color Palette
The canvas is paper, the ink is sharp.

### Surfaces (The Gallery)
- **Canvas White:** `#F9F9F7` (Warm, natural paper feel - Main Background)
- **Pure White:** `#FFFFFF` (Cards / Focus areas)
- **Vapor Gray:** `#F2F2F0` (Secondary sections)

### Ink (The Content)
- **Jet Black:** `#1A1A1A` (Primary Text / Headings)
- **Graphite:** `#555555` (Secondary Text)
- **Silver:** `#D1D1D1` (Borders, Dividers - Very subtle)

### Accents (The Badge)
- **International Orange:** `#E63946` (Call to action / Highlights - Minimal usage)
- **Electric Blue:** `#2D5BFF` (Links / Interactive states)

## 3. Typography System
Editorial elegance meets structural data.

- **Primary Font (The Narrative):** `Inter` (Clean, geometric). 
    - *Usage:* Body text, UI elements.
- **Secondary Font (The Data):** `JetBrains Mono` (Technical, precise).
    - *Usage:* Navigation, Meta-data, Stats, Tags.

## 4. UI Patterns & Signatures

### The "Golden" Grid
Layouts should be asymmetrical but balanced. Use large margins and whitespace as active design elements.

### Fine Lines
Borders should be hairline thin (`1px`), often separating large sections, mimicking an editorial layout.

### Soft Shadows
Drop shadows should be diffuse and large, lifting elements gently off the page rather than creating harsh depth. `box-shadow: 0 20px 40px -10px rgba(0,0,0,0.05);`

### "WIP" Aesthetic: The Curator
For the "Works in Progress" sections:
- Metaphor: **"Archiving"** or **"Curation"**.
- Visuals: Blurred content, skeletons that look like sketches, "Coming Soon" tags that look like gallery labels.

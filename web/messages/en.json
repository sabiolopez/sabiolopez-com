            "ai_focus": "Over the last two years, an interest in artificial intelligence has taken on a significant role. It is a field still in formation, and the focus has been on exploring practical applications, understanding how AI can integrate into work processes, design methods, and, in some cases, be thought of as a product. Whenever possible, this exploration happens not only in the final result but throughout the process itself—just like in this portfolio."
